# PFE_Internship
My internship project at DICE (UM6P) focuses on developing an intelligent receptionist robot with multimodal interaction and autonomous navigation. The robot will be capable of recognizing faces, understanding speech, and responding via a chatbot, while also navigating autonomously using ROS, SLAM, and LiDAR.
